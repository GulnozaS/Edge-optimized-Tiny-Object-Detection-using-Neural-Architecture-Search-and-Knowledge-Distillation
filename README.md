This repository contains the implementation for our computer vision project: **Edge-Optimized Tiny Object Detection using Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search and Knowledge Distillation**.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge of detecting small objects on resource-constrained edge devices by combining:
- **Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (NAS)** to find efficient architectures
- **Knowledge Distillation (KD)** to transfer knowledge from large teacher models
- **Edge optimization** for deployment on NVIDIA Jetson devices

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- NVIDIA GPU (for training)
- NVIDIA Jetson Nano (for edge deployment)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GulnozaS/Edge-optimized-Tiny-Object-Detection-using-Neural-Architecture-Search-and-Knowledge-Distillation.git
