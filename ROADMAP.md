## üìÜ Weekly Check-ins
Each week, add 3‚Äì6 short update bullets below this section.

### ‚úÖ Week 1 Update
- Topic finalized: *Edge-Optimized Tiny Object Detection using NAS & KD*  
- Repository created and structured  
- Initial README.md and proposal prepared  
- Division of labor established (Gulnoza ‚Äì modeling, Feruza ‚Äì data)

### üîÑ Week 2 Update
_(to be filled after week 2)_

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Checkpoints Summary
| Milestone | Target Date | Verification |
|------------|--------------|---------------|
| One-page outline submitted | Week 1 | ‚úÖ |
| Dataset access verified | Week 2 | ‚è≥ |
| Baseline results reproduced | Week 3 | ‚è≥ |
| Method & metrics finalized | Week 4 | ‚è≥ |
| Interim results produced | Week 5 | ‚è≥ |
| Error analysis complete | Week 6 | ‚è≥ |
| Edge testing complete | Week 7 | ‚è≥ |
| Final report submitted | Week 8 | ‚è≥ |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation Plan |
|------|------------------|
| Dataset too large for available compute | Use a small subset or lightweight dataset (Tiny COCO, VisDrone subset) |
| Model training too slow on Jetson | Pre-train on GPU, then fine-tune on Jetson |
| mAP improvement below 10% | Add data augmentation and refine distillation loss |
| NAS search too computationally heavy | Use lightweight search space and early stopping |
